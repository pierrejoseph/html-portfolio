<h1>The Best Movies According to Pierre</h1>
<br/>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Rock</h3>
<p>From start to finish, the rock is action-packed. It never lets up, a true action hero movie.<br/>
The best part is seeing how the antagonist had a change of heart, but his second in command didnt<br/>
which led them to have a fallout and turn on each other.</p>

<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
<p>Ex Machina is ever so relevent presently given the stride AI has a made over the past two years.<br />
The question is, what does it mean to be human. Are we in danger of AI becoming too self-aware?</p>

<h3>Inside Llewyn Davis</h3>
<p>For every artist, whether it been singer, actor, or dancer, for every artist that makes it in their <br/>
respective field, there are ten others that did not, and twenty that gave up. Among the ones that did not <br/>
give up, there are those whom that lead to their own demise.</p>
